## Angular Baboon
tl;dr I don't care about baboons, take me to the [Angular stuff](Baboon.Angular.App/README.md)

This is [Entelect's](http://www.entelect.co.za/) seed project for [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) applications.

## Angular Baboon's Goals
The intent of this seed project is to reduce the amount of plumbing and boiler plate code required to get an Angular application up and running.
Furthermore, Angular Baboon seeks to bring together Entelect's consensus on Angular best practices and act as a point of reference between Entelect's Angular projects.

## Some Nifty Features

* Multiple Angular applications in a single solution architecture.
* Scalable Angualr project structures.
