## Angular Baboon (Alpha)
tl;dr I don't care about baboons, take me to the [Angular stuff](Baboon.Angular.App/README.md)

This is [Entelect's](http://www.entelect.co.za/) seed project for [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) applications.

## Angular Baboon's Goals
The intent of this seed project is to reduce the amount of plumbing and boiler plate code required to get an Angular application up and running.
Furthermore, Angular Baboon seeks to bring together Entelect's consensus on Angular best practices and act as a point of reference between Entelect's Angular projects.

## Some Nifty Features

* Architecture for multiple Angular applications in a single solution.
* Scalable Angular project structures.
* Multiple environment configurations (dev, QA and live)
* Continuous integration ready build tasks with TeamCity test reporters.
* Out the box testing environment and test runner configuration.
* A collection of [common modules](Baboon.Angular.Common/README.md)
* ...

## Some Nifty Experimental Features

* A bootstrap style guide generator per Angular application (without Ruby and Jekyll and all that jazz)

## A Note on Alpha Development

As the title suggests, Angular Baboon is currently only an alpha release. 
Over the course of the alpha development phase, we'll be improving the documentation, extending the demo applications and testing some of the new experimental features.

## Angular Baboon's Opinion
Angular Baboon is an opinionated seed project. So take the bits you like and delete the rest.

Angular Baboon tries to use the latest and greatest Angular tools, but also takes into consideration the stability and maturity of the tools.

Angular Baboon sticks to raw JavaScript, but should be convertible or extensible to the language of your choice by introducing the appropriate transpilers.
