## Angular Baboon (Alpha)
tl;dr I don't care about baboons, take me to the [Angular stuff](Baboon.Angular.App/README.md)

This is [Entelect's](http://www.entelect.co.za/) seed project for [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) applications.

## Angular Baboon's Goals
The intent of this seed project is to reduce the amount of plumbing and boiler plate code required to get an Angular application up and running.
Furthermore, Angular Baboon seeks to bring together Entelect's consensus on Angular best practices and act as a point of reference between Entelect's Angular projects.

## Some Nifty Features

* Architecure for multiple Angular applications in a single solution.
* Scalable Angular project structures.
* Multiple environment configurations (dev, QA and live)
* Continuous integration ready build tasks with TeamCity test reporters.
* Out the box testing enviroment and test runner configuration.
* A collection of [common modules](Baboon.Angular.Common/README.md)
* ...

## Angular Baboon's Opinion
Angular Baboon is an opinionated seed project. So take the bits you like and delete the rest.

Angular Baboon tries to use the latest and greatest Angular tools, but also takes into consideration the stability and maturity of the tools.

Angular Baboon sticks to raw JavaScript, but should be convertable or extensible to the language of your choice by introducing the appropriate transpilers.
